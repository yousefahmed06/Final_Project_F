# UK Train Rides Analysis Project

## üìä Project Overview

This project delves into UK railway data to uncover the causes of delays, analyze travel behavior, and forecast demand. Utilizing Python (Pandas, Seaborn) for data analysis and Power BI for visualization, the project offers insights to optimize train scheduling and enhance passenger experience.

## üìÅ Repository Contents

* **Final_project.ipynb**: Jupyter Notebook containing data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and modeling processes.
* **Final Project.pbix**: Power BI file with interactive dashboards visualizing delays, ticket sales, and journey performance.
* **Railway_clean.csv**: Cleaned dataset used for analysis.
* **railway.csv**: Original raw dataset.
* **Business insights.pdf**: Document summarizing key business insights derived from the analysis.
* **Dashboard.pdf**: Static version of the Power BI dashboard.
* **UK Train Rides Technical Report.pdf**: Comprehensive technical report detailing methodologies and findings.

## üß∞ Tools & Technologies

* **Python Libraries**:

  * Pandas
  * Seaborn
  * Matplotib
* **Data Visualization**:

  * Power BI
* **Data Processing**:

  * Jupyter Notebook([GitHub][1])

## üßπ Data Cleaning & Preparation

* **Handled Missing Values**: Imputed gaps in 'Railcard' and 'Reason_For_Delay' columns.
* **Standardization**: Renamed columns and converted string fields to datetime objects for consistency.

## üìà Key Insights

* **Delay Patterns**: Identified peak delay times and common causes.
* **Travel Behavior**: Analyzed ticket purchase trends and class preferences.
* **Demand Forecasting**: Predicted future travel demand to aid in resource allocation.([GitHub][2], [GitHub][3])
